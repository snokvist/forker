# Project Review

## Observed inconsistencies
The previously noted gaps (default config path, SIGUSR1 documentation mismatch, and the `$log_interva` placeholder typo) have been resolved. No new inconsistencies were observed in this pass.

## Suggested improvements
- Keep the README’s signal section aligned with the code whenever handlers change so operators know what is actionable at runtime.
